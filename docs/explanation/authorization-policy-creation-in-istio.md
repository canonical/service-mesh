# Authorization Policy Creation in Istio

```{note}
This page is planned but not yet written
```

TODO Notes: 
* Should this be more Authorizaiton Policy Management rather than creation? Where do we explain the general concept of authorization policies, or traffic authorization, or some other name?  Would be useful to link in the how-to for mesh support and the explanation for managed-mode
